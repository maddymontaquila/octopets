# Tasks: Pet Sitter Marketplace

**Feature Branch**: `001-pet-sitter-marketplace`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-pet-sitter-marketplace/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/pet-owner-api.yaml ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification, so test tasks are excluded per template instructions.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can start immediately after Phase 2
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can run in PARALLEL with User Story 1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 and 2 (needs search, profiles, and basic booking)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 3 (needs completed bookings for reviews)
- **User Story 6 (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Story 1 (enhances existing search)
- **Agent Integration (Phase 8)**: Optional, depends on User Story 1 and 2
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Independence

- ‚úÖ **User Story 1 (Search & Booking)**: Can be developed, tested, and deployed independently after Phase 2
- ‚úÖ **User Story 2 (Profile Management)**: Can be developed in PARALLEL with US1, independently testable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **User Story 3 (Booking Management)**: Requires US1 (booking creation) and US2 (sitter profiles) to be complete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **User Story 5 (Reviews)**: Requires US3 (completed bookings) to be complete
- ‚úÖ **User Story 6 (Advanced Filters)**: Extends US1 but can be tested independently by verifying filter logic

### Within Each User Story

- Backend models before repositories
- Repositories before endpoints
- Endpoints registered before frontend integration
- Frontend service layer before pages/components
- Pages before components that use them
- Mock data synchronized after backend models defined
- Integration testing after all pieces complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002 and T003 can run in parallel (different model files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T009 and T010 can run in parallel (different repository files), T012 can run in parallel with backend work

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**: 
- T016, T020, T024, T028 can all start in parallel (different endpoint files)
- T030, T031, T032, T033 can all start in parallel (different component files)
- T037, T038, T039, T043 can all start in parallel (different component files)

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- T061, T062, T069 can run in parallel (different endpoint methods)
- T072, T073, T074, T082, T087, T093 can run in parallel (different components)

**Phases 3 and 4 can run in PARALLEL** if team capacity allows - US1 and US2 are independently deliverable

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Team can work on different areas simultaneously after T006-T007 complete:

Developer A:
- T008: Backend repositories (PetOwner, PetSitter)
- T011: Register repositories

Developer B (parallel):
- T009: Backend repositories (Booking, Service)
- T010: Backend repositories (Availability, Message, Pet)

Developer C (parallel):
- T012: Frontend service files
- T013: Frontend mock data files
- T014: Frontend config updates
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (MVP)

```bash
# Once Phase 2 complete, can split US1 work:

Backend Developer:
- T016-T019: Search endpoints
- T020-T023: Sitter profile endpoints
- T024-T027: Booking endpoints
- T028-T029: Pet owner endpoints

Frontend Developer (parallel):
- T030-T036: Search interface
- T037-T042: Sitter profile view
- T043-T047: Booking form
- T048-T050: Owner dashboard

Mock Data Developer (parallel):
- T051-T054: Mock data synchronization
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T015) - **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT**
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T060) - Search and Booking
4. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T061-T107) - Profile Management (can overlap with US1)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both stories independently, verify constitution compliance
6. Deploy/demo if ready - This is a functional marketplace MVP!

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Core marketplace function!)
3. Add User Story 2 (parallel or sequential) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Complete marketplace MVP!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full lifecycle management)
5. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Trust and ratings)
6. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Enhanced discovery)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3+ developers after Phase 2 complete:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T015)
2. **Split into parallel workstreams:**
   - Developer A: User Story 1 - Search & Booking (T016-T060)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 - Profile Management (T061-T107)
   - Developer C: Polish & Infrastructure (T220-T240 selectively)
3. **Stories complete and integrate independently**

With 2 developers:
1. Both work on Foundational (faster completion of blocker)
2. Developer A: User Story 1
3. Developer B: User Story 2 (parallel)
4. Both: User Story 3 (requires integration)
5. Split: User Story 5 and 6 (can be parallel)

## Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 240 tasks across 9 phases
- **MVP Tasks**: T001-T107 (107 tasks for User Stories 1 + 2)
- **Critical Path**: Setup ‚Üí Foundational (15 tasks, BLOCKS everything) ‚Üí User Stories (priority order)
- **Parallel Opportunities**: 
  - Phase 1: 2 task groups
  - Phase 2: 3 task groups
  - Phase 3: 4 task groups (backend, frontend, mock data can be parallel)
  - Phase 4: Can run ENTIRELY parallel with Phase 3 if staffed
- **User Stories**:
  - US1 (P1): 45 tasks - Search and Booking (MVP core)
  - US2 (P1): 47 tasks - Profile Management (MVP core, parallel with US1)
  - US3 (P2): 49 tasks - Booking Management & Communication
  - US5 (P3): 29 tasks - Reviews & Ratings
  - US6 (P3): 28 tasks - Advanced Filters
- **Constitution Compliance**: All tasks follow mock data sync, Aspire orchestration, service discovery, and independent story delivery principles

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability and independent delivery
- **Checkpoint validation**: Stop after each user story phase to test independently
- **Mock data sync**: T051-T054, T097-T100, T145-T148, T176-T179 are CRITICAL - must maintain parity
- **Constitution VII compliance**: Each user story delivers standalone value and can be deployed independently
- **MVP recommendation**: Complete US1 + US2 (Phases 1-4) for functional marketplace
- **Testing approach**: Manual testing via Aspire Dashboard, frontend E2E tests for critical paths, optional backend tests
- **User Story 4 (Payment)**: Intentionally deferred to future phase - not in current task breakdown
