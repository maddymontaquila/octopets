# Feature Specification: Octopets Pet Sitter Marketplace

**Feature Branch**: `001-pet-sitter-marketplace`  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application called Octopets that is like an AirB&B for pet sitters and owners. Pet Owners should be able to search for pet sitters in their location and have scheduling capabilties. Pet sittters should be able to customize their profile, skills, and services offered."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Pet Owner Searches and Books Sitter (Priority: P1)

As a pet owner, I need to find and book a qualified pet sitter in my local area for specific dates so that my pet receives proper care while I'm away.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - connecting pet owners with sitters. Without search and booking, the marketplace has no function. This story delivers immediate value and can be tested end-to-end.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a pet owner account, searching by location and dates, viewing sitter profiles, and completing a booking request. Delivers the fundamental marketplace value of connecting supply and demand.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a logged-in pet owner, **When** I enter my zip code and desired dates, **Then** I see a list of available pet sitters in my area
2. **Given** I am viewing search results, **When** I click on a sitter profile, **Then** I see their full profile including services, rates, availability, and reviews
3. **Given** I am viewing a sitter's profile, **When** I select dates and request a booking, **Then** the sitter receives my booking request and I receive a confirmation that my request was sent
4. **Given** I have submitted a booking request, **When** the sitter accepts my request, **Then** I receive a confirmation notification and the booking appears in my dashboard
5. **Given** I am searching for sitters, **When** no sitters are available for my selected dates, **Then** I see a message indicating no availability and suggestions to expand my search criteria

### User Story 2 - Pet Sitter Profile Management (Priority: P1)

As a pet sitter, I need to create and maintain a comprehensive profile showcasing my skills, services, and availability so that pet owners can evaluate if I'm the right fit for their needs.

**Why this priority**: Without sitter profiles, pet owners cannot make informed decisions. This is equally critical to search functionality - supply must exist for the marketplace to function. This can be developed and tested independently of the booking flow.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a sitter account and configuring all profile elements (bio, services, rates, availability, photos). Delivers value by allowing sitters to establish their presence and pet owners to view detailed information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a new pet sitter, **When** I complete the registration process, **Then** I am guided to create my profile with required information
2. **Given** I am editing my profile, **When** I add or update my services (dog walking, overnight stays, medication administration, etc.), **Then** these services are saved and displayed on my public profile
3. **Given** I am editing my profile, **When** I set my hourly rates or service-specific pricing, **Then** pet owners can see my pricing when viewing my profile
4. **Given** I am managing my profile, **When** I upload photos of myself or my home, **Then** these photos appear on my public profile
5. **Given** I am setting up my profile, **When** I specify my skills (breeds experienced with, special needs care, training certifications), **Then** these qualifications are visible to pet owners and can be used in search filters
6. **Given** I am managing availability, **When** I mark dates as unavailable, **Then** I do not appear in search results for those dates

---

### User Story 3 - Booking Management and Communication (Priority: P2)

As a pet owner or pet sitter, I need to manage my bookings and communicate with the other party so that we can coordinate pet care details and handle any changes.

**Why this priority**: While essential for a complete experience, basic search and profile creation provide minimum viable value. This story enhances the experience but requires the foundational P1 stories to be in place.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating booking creation, acceptance/decline flows, messaging between parties, and status updates. Delivers value by enabling coordination and communication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a pet sitter with pending booking requests, **When** I view my dashboard, **Then** I see all pending requests with pet owner details and requested dates
2. **Given** I am a pet sitter reviewing a booking request, **When** I accept or decline the request, **Then** the pet owner is notified of my decision
3. **Given** I have an active booking, **When** I send a message to the other party, **Then** they receive the message and can reply
4. **Given** I need to cancel a booking, **When** I initiate cancellation with a reason, **Then** the other party is notified and the cancellation policy is applied
5. **Given** I am a pet owner with an upcoming booking, **When** I view booking details, **Then** I see the sitter's contact information, service details, dates, and total cost

---

### User Story 4 - Reviews and Ratings (Priority: P3)

As a pet owner, I need to read reviews from other pet owners and leave reviews after my booking so that I can make informed decisions and help build trust in the community.

**Why this priority**: Reviews build trust and credibility but are not essential for the initial marketplace launch. The marketplace can function without reviews initially, though they significantly enhance quality over time.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing bookings, submitting reviews, viewing aggregate ratings on profiles, and filtering search results by rating. Delivers value by providing social proof and quality signals.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have completed a booking, **When** I access my booking history, **Then** I see an option to leave a review for that sitter
2. **Given** I am leaving a review, **When** I submit a rating (1-5 stars) and written feedback, **Then** the review appears on the sitter's profile after moderation
3. **Given** I am viewing a sitter's profile, **When** I scroll to the reviews section, **Then** I see their average rating, number of reviews, and individual review details
4. **Given** I am searching for sitters, **When** I apply a minimum rating filter, **Then** only sitters meeting that rating threshold appear in results

---

### User Story 5 - Search Filters and Advanced Matching (Priority: P3)

As a pet owner, I need to filter search results by specific criteria (pet type, services offered, special skills, price range) so that I can quickly find sitters who meet my specific needs.

**Why this priority**: Basic location and date search (P1) provides core functionality. Advanced filters enhance user experience but aren't required for minimum viability. This can be added incrementally after core search works.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by applying various filter combinations and verifying result accuracy. Delivers value by reducing search time and improving match quality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the search page, **When** I filter by pet type (dog, cat, bird, reptile, etc.), **Then** only sitters who service that pet type appear
2. **Given** I am viewing search results, **When** I filter by specific services (overnight stays, daily walks, medication administration), **Then** only sitters offering those services appear
3. **Given** I am searching for sitters, **When** I set a maximum price range, **Then** only sitters within my budget appear
4. **Given** I am filtering results, **When** I select multiple filter criteria, **Then** results match all selected filters (AND logic)
5. **Given** I have applied filters, **When** I clear filters, **Then** I return to the full unfiltered results list

---

### User Story 6 - Payment Processing (Priority: Future)

As a pet owner, I need to securely pay for pet sitting services through the platform so that both parties have payment protection and dispute resolution.

**Why this priority**: Payment integration will be implemented in a future phase. Initial version focuses on connecting pet owners and sitters, who will arrange payment terms directly.

**Independent Test**: Deferred to future implementation phase.

**Acceptance Scenarios**: To be defined when payment system is implemented.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a pet owner searches in a location with no registered sitters?
- How does the system handle double-booking scenarios where a sitter accepts multiple requests for overlapping dates?
- What happens when a sitter wants to cancel an accepted booking close to the start date?
- How does the system handle time zone differences when showing availability?
- What happens if a pet owner doesn't specify the type of pet they need sitting for?
- How does the system handle partial availability (sitter available for some but not all requested dates)?
- What happens when a user tries to book dates in the past?
- How does the system handle sitters who want to offer services for multiple pet types with different rates?
- How does the system handle cases where a sitter has insufficient profile information (missing photos, empty bio)?
- How do pet owners and sitters coordinate payment terms without integrated payment processing?
