# Implementation Plan: Octopets Pet Sitter Marketplace

**Branch**: `001-pet-sitter-marketplace` | **Date**: October 21, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)  
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-pet-sitter-marketplace/spec.md`

## Summary

Build a comprehensive pet sitter marketplace application that connects pet owners with qualified pet sitters. The system enables pet owners to search for sitters by location and dates, view detailed sitter profiles, submit booking requests, and communicate with sitters. Pet sitters can create customizable profiles showcasing their services, skills, rates, and availability. The platform includes booking management, in-app messaging, reviews and ratings, and advanced search filters. Payment processing is deferred to a future phase; initial version supports booking coordination with direct payment arrangements between parties.

**Technical Approach**: Extend the existing .NET Aspire-orchestrated architecture with new backend API endpoints, frontend pages/components, enhanced data models, and potential AI agent enhancements for intelligent matching and recommendations. Leverage existing infrastructure (AppHost, ServiceDefaults, mock data patterns, multi-agent framework) while adding marketplace-specific functionality.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: 
- Backend: C# / .NET 9.0 (ASP.NET Core)
- Frontend: TypeScript / React 18
- AI Agents: Python 3.11+ with Microsoft Agent Framework

**Primary Dependencies**: 
- Backend: ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, Entity Framework Core (In-Memory), Aspire.Hosting
- Frontend: React 18, React Router v6, TypeScript 5+
- Agents: Microsoft Agent Framework (preview), FastAPI, Azure AI Foundry SDK, httpx, uv

**Storage**: Entity Framework Core In-Memory database (backend), localStorage (frontend for user preferences)

**Testing**: 
- Backend: xUnit (planned)
- Frontend: Playwright for E2E tests
- Agents: pytest (planned)

**Target Platform**: 
- Development: macOS/Linux/Windows via .NET Aspire
- Production: Azure Container Apps via Aspire deployment

**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend + multi-agent system)

**Performance Goals**: 
- Search results display in <3 seconds
- Agent responses in <10 seconds
- Support 500 concurrent users
- Page load times <2 seconds

**Constraints**: 
- Must maintain mock data synchronization across frontend/backend
- All services orchestrated via Aspire AppHost
- No hardcoded URLs (use Aspire service discovery)
- Python agents use uv package management only
- In-memory database resets on restart (acceptable for MVP)

**Scale/Scope**: 
- MVP: 6 prioritized user stories (P1: 2, P2: 2, P3: 2, Future: 1)
- 48 functional requirements
- 10 key entities
- 3 primary user roles (pet owner, pet sitter, system/admin)
- Estimated 15-25 new backend endpoints
- Estimated 10-15 new frontend pages/components

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### ✅ I. Aspire-First Orchestration
- **Status**: PASS
- **Compliance**: All new services will be registered in existing AppHost.cs. No standalone execution.
- **Actions**: Register new endpoints via existing `api` project reference. No new services required for MVP (reuses existing backend/frontend/agents).

### ✅ II. Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Status**: PASS (with enhancement opportunities)
- **Compliance**: Existing agents (chat, sitter, orchestrator) follow all principles. Will assess if new specialized agents needed for marketplace features.
- **Actions**: 
  - Evaluate if existing agents can handle marketplace queries or if new "booking" or "matching" agents needed
  - If new agents required, follow established pattern: FastAPI, /agent/chat endpoint, /health endpoint, uv dependencies, DefaultAzureCredential
  - Orchestrator remains default entry point for complex queries

### ✅ III. Mock Data Synchronization (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Status**: PASS
- **Compliance**: Will maintain strict parity across all three locations
- **Actions**:
  1. Extend `/data/listing.json` with new marketplace entities (bookings, reviews, sitter profiles, etc.)
  2. Update `frontend/src/data/listingsData.ts` (and create new data files as needed)
  3. Update `backend/Data/AppDbContext.cs` SeedData method
  4. All model changes update all three locations simultaneously
  5. Verify `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_DATA` toggle continues to work

### ✅ IV. Service Discovery & Dynamic Configuration
- **Status**: PASS
- **Compliance**: No hardcoded URLs. All existing patterns followed.
- **Actions**:
  - Backend reads `FRONTEND_URL` from environment for CORS
  - Frontend reads agent URLs from environment variables set by AppHost
  - All new endpoints use relative paths or environment-injected URLs

### ✅ V. Environment-Aware Behavior
- **Status**: PASS
- **Compliance**: Existing `IsPublishMode` checks in place. Will extend for new features.
- **Actions**:
  - Dev mode: Enable all CRUD operations for testing
  - Prod mode: Disable CRUD operations except read-only search/view
  - Mock data flag already configured in AppHost (dev=true, prod=false)

### ✅ VI. Observability & Telemetry
- **Status**: PASS
- **Compliance**: Existing services configured with OpenTelemetry. Will maintain for new endpoints.
- **Actions**:
  - All new backend endpoints use structured logging via `app.Logger`
  - Health checks continue to work at `/health`
  - Aspire Dashboard remains primary development monitoring tool
  - Application Insights enabled in production via existing configuration

### ✅ VII. Independent User Story Delivery
- **Status**: PASS
- **Compliance**: Spec defines 6 independently testable user stories with priorities
- **Actions**:
  - Phase structure will follow: Setup → Foundational → User Stories (by priority) → Polish
  - P1 stories (Search/Booking + Profile Management) are independently deliverable
  - P2 stories (Booking Management, Payment coordination) build on P1
  - P3 stories (Reviews, Advanced Filters) are additive enhancements
  - Task organization will group by user story in tasks.md

### Constitution Compliance Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ PASS - No constitution violations. Plan fully compliant.

**Notes**: 
- Existing architecture already implements all constitution principles
- Plan extends existing patterns rather than introducing new complexity
- No new services required at AppHost level (reuses existing api/frontend/agents)
- Mock data synchronization will require discipline but follows established pattern
- User story independence is well-defined in spec, will translate directly to tasks

**Structure Decision**: 

This feature extends the existing **Web Application** structure (Option 2 from template). The Octopets project already has a mature backend/frontend/multi-agent architecture orchestrated by .NET Aspire. The marketplace feature will:

1. **Reuse existing infrastructure**: AppHost, ServiceDefaults, agent framework, deployment patterns
2. **Extend backend**: Add new models, repositories, and endpoint files following established Minimal API pattern
3. **Extend frontend**: Add new pages and components following existing React structure with TypeScript
4. **Enhance agents**: Review if existing agents (chat for listings, sitter, orchestrator) need marketplace-specific tools or if new specialized agent required
5. **Maintain mock data sync**: Add new JSON files in `/data` and sync to frontend/backend as per constitution

The structure leverages proven patterns (repository pattern, endpoint grouping, component organization) and maintains constitutional compliance (Aspire orchestration, service discovery, environment-aware behavior, mock data synchronization).

## Complexity Tracking

*No constitution violations identified. This section left empty per template guidance.*

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0: Research & Technical Discovery

**Objective**: Understand existing codebase patterns, validate architectural assumptions, identify reusable components, and document technical constraints.

**Deliverable**: `research.md` documenting:
- Existing authentication/authorization patterns (if any)
- Current EF Core model patterns and migration strategy (in-memory reset behavior)
- Frontend routing and state management approaches
- Agent tool definition patterns and Azure AI Foundry integration
- Mock data synchronization workflows
- CORS configuration and service discovery patterns
- Existing search/filter implementations (if any)
- Photo upload/storage patterns (if implemented elsewhere)
- Geolocation/distance calculation libraries or approaches
- Date/calendar handling patterns (availability management)

**Key Questions to Answer**:
1. Does existing codebase have user authentication/sessions, or is this marketplace the first user-facing feature?
2. Are there existing file upload patterns for sitter photos, or is this new?
3. How are geographic searches currently handled (listings by location)?
4. What date/calendar libraries are used in frontend, if any?
5. Do existing agents have tools that could be reused for marketplace matching?
6. Is there an existing notification system, or do we need to build messaging from scratch?
7. What's the current approach to user roles (owner vs sitter)?

**Research Tasks**:
- [ ] Inventory existing backend Models and identify reusable entities
- [ ] Review ListingEndpoints.cs and ReviewEndpoints.cs for endpoint patterns
- [ ] Examine frontend agentService.ts to understand agent integration patterns
- [ ] Review existing mock data structure in `/data/listing.json` and backend SeedData
- [ ] Identify if geolocation/mapping libraries are already in use
- [ ] Check if photo storage is handled (local files, Azure Blob, etc.)
- [ ] Understand current error handling and validation patterns
- [ ] Review existing E2E test patterns in frontend/tests

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] research.md completed with architectural patterns documented
- [ ] All key questions answered with code examples
- [ ] Identified reusable components vs. net-new development
- [ ] Technical risks and constraints documented
- [ ] Recommended libraries/packages for new functionality (geolocation, calendars, etc.)

### Phase 1: Architecture & Design

**Objective**: Design detailed data models, API contracts, frontend routes, and agent interactions for the marketplace feature.

**Deliverables**:
1. `data-model.md`: Complete entity definitions with properties, relationships, validation rules
2. `quickstart.md`: Developer onboarding guide for marketplace feature
3. `contracts/api-endpoints.md`: Full REST API specification with request/response schemas
4. `contracts/frontend-routes.md`: Route definitions and page responsibilities
5. `contracts/agent-protocols.md`: Agent tool definitions and query patterns

**Design Activities**:

#### Data Model Design
- Define all 10 key entities with complete property lists:
  - PetOwner (id, email, name, contactInfo, pets[], bookings[], reviews[])
  - PetSitter (id, email, name, bio, location, services[], rates, availability[], photos[], skills[], reviews[])
  - Booking (id, ownerId, sitterId, petId, startDate, endDate, status, serviceIds[], totalCost, paymentStatus)
  - Service (id, name, description, category, pricing)
  - Availability (id, sitterId, date, isAvailable)
  - Review (id, bookingId, authorId, targetId, rating, comment, date)
  - Message (id, senderId, recipientId, bookingId, content, timestamp, isRead)
  - Pet (id, ownerId, name, type, breed, age, specialNeeds)
  - Profile (extends PetSitter with additional metadata)
  - Location (id, address, city, state, zipCode, latitude, longitude)

- Document entity relationships and navigation properties
- Define validation rules (required fields, string lengths, enum values)
- Map entities to EF Core configurations

#### API Contract Design
Endpoint groups (15-25 total endpoints estimated):

**PetOwner Endpoints** (~5 endpoints):
- POST /api/owners - Create owner account
- GET /api/owners/{id} - Get owner profile
- PUT /api/owners/{id} - Update owner profile
- GET /api/owners/{id}/bookings - Get owner's bookings
- GET /api/owners/{id}/pets - Get owner's pets

**PetSitter Endpoints** (~8 endpoints):
- POST /api/sitters - Create sitter account
- GET /api/sitters/{id} - Get public sitter profile
- PUT /api/sitters/{id} - Update sitter profile
- GET /api/sitters/{id}/services - Get sitter's services
- PUT /api/sitters/{id}/services - Update services
- GET /api/sitters/{id}/availability - Get availability calendar
- PUT /api/sitters/{id}/availability - Update availability
- POST /api/sitters/{id}/photos - Upload photos

**Search Endpoints** (~3 endpoints):
- GET /api/search/sitters - Search sitters by location/date/filters
- GET /api/search/nearby - Get sitters within radius
- GET /api/search/available - Check availability for date range

**Booking Endpoints** (~6 endpoints):
- POST /api/bookings - Create booking request
- GET /api/bookings/{id} - Get booking details
- PUT /api/bookings/{id}/accept - Accept booking (sitter)
- PUT /api/bookings/{id}/decline - Decline booking (sitter)
- PUT /api/bookings/{id}/cancel - Cancel booking
- GET /api/bookings/pending - Get pending bookings (sitter)

**Message Endpoints** (~4 endpoints):
- POST /api/messages - Send message
- GET /api/messages/booking/{bookingId} - Get messages for booking
- PUT /api/messages/{id}/read - Mark message as read
- GET /api/messages/unread - Get unread message count

**Review Endpoints** (~3 endpoints):
- POST /api/reviews - Submit review
- GET /api/reviews/sitter/{sitterId} - Get sitter's reviews
- GET /api/reviews/booking/{bookingId} - Get review for booking

#### Frontend Route Design
- `/` - Home page (search interface)
- `/search` - Search results page
- `/sitters/:id` - Public sitter profile
- `/sitters/:id/book` - Booking request form
- `/dashboard/owner` - Pet owner dashboard
- `/dashboard/sitter` - Pet sitter dashboard
- `/bookings/:id` - Booking details
- `/messages` - Messaging interface
- `/profile/edit` - Sitter profile edit (sitter only)
- `/reviews/new` - Submit review (owner only)

#### Agent Integration Design
- **Existing Chat Agent**: May enhance for venue-to-sitter matching recommendations
- **Existing Sitter Agent**: May enhance for sitter profile Q&A and service recommendations
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Add new tool functions:
  - `find_available_sitters(location, dates, filters)` - Search coordination
  - `get_sitter_recommendations(user_preferences, pet_details)` - AI matching
  - `query_booking_status(booking_id)` - Booking information
  - Consider if new specialized "Booking Agent" needed for complex booking logic

#### Mock Data Design
Create comprehensive mock datasets:
- 10-15 mock pet sitters with varied services, locations, availability
- 5-8 mock pet owners with different pets and booking histories
- 20-30 mock bookings showing various statuses
- 15-20 mock reviews with ratings
- Sample messages for several booking threads
- Service type catalog (overnight, daily visit, walking, medication, grooming)

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] data-model.md completed with all entity schemas
- [ ] contracts/api-endpoints.md with complete REST API spec
- [ ] contracts/frontend-routes.md with page wireframes/responsibilities
- [ ] contracts/agent-protocols.md with tool definitions
- [ ] quickstart.md provides clear feature onboarding
- [ ] Mock data structure defined in all three locations (/data, frontend, backend)
- [ ] Design reviewed against constitution (re-run Constitution Check)

### Phase 2: Task Breakdown (via /speckit.tasks)

**Objective**: Decompose design into discrete, estimable implementation tasks organized by user story.

**Deliverable**: `tasks.md` generated by `/speckit.tasks` command

**Task Organization Principle** (per Constitution VII):
1. **Setup Phase**: Repository structure, package installation, initial mock data
2. **Foundational Phase**: Core infrastructure that blocks all stories:
   - Database models and migrations (EF Core in-memory setup)
   - Base repository interfaces and implementations
   - Authentication/authorization scaffolding (if needed)
   - Frontend routing setup
   - Agent tool scaffolding
3. **User Story Phases** (in priority order):
   - **P1 Story 1**: Pet Owner Search & Booking (independently deliverable)
   - **P1 Story 2**: Pet Sitter Profile Management (parallel to Story 1)
   - **P2 Story 3**: Booking Management & Communication
   - **P2 Story 4**: (Future) Payment Processing (deferred)
   - **P3 Story 5**: Reviews & Ratings
   - **P3 Story 6**: Advanced Search Filters
4. **Polish Phase**: Error handling, loading states, responsive design, accessibility

**Estimated Task Count**: 60-100 tasks across all phases

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] tasks.md generated with complete task breakdown
- [ ] Each task maps to specific user story or foundational work
- [ ] Tasks are independently estimable (< 4 hour ideal size)
- [ ] Dependencies between tasks clearly marked
- [ ] Tasks organized to enable parallel development where possible

### Phase 3-N: Implementation by User Story

Implementation phases will be executed in user story priority order per the generated tasks.md. Each phase follows the workflow:

1. **Implement foundational dependencies** (Phase 2 tasks)
2. **Implement P1 Story 1** (Search & Booking) - Independently deliverable MVP
3. **Implement P1 Story 2** (Profile Management) - Can be done in parallel with Story 1
4. **Validate P1 delivery** - Test independently, verify constitution compliance
5. **Implement P2 stories** (Booking Management, Payment coordination)
6. **Implement P3 stories** (Reviews, Advanced Filters)
7. **Polish phase** - Cross-cutting improvements

**Implementation follows Constitution VII**: Each story is independently testable, delivers standalone value, and can be deployed/demoed without other stories.

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Mock data synchronization breaks during rapid development | HIGH - Blocks local dev | MEDIUM | Automated validation script, clear documentation, PR checklist |
| Geographic search complexity underestimated | MEDIUM - Core feature | MEDIUM | Phase 0 research existing patterns, consider using established library (e.g., GeoCoordinate) |
| Agent integration for marketplace queries unclear | MEDIUM - AI features | LOW | Phase 1 prototyping, fallback to direct API calls if agent approach doesn't add value |
| File upload for sitter photos not yet implemented | MEDIUM - Profile feature | MEDIUM | Research existing patterns in Phase 0, consider Azure Blob or local file storage |
| No existing authentication system | HIGH - Security | MEDIUM | Research Phase 0, may need to implement auth as foundational work before user stories |

### Medium Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Availability calendar complexity | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Use existing calendar libraries (react-calendar, date-fns), keep logic simple |
| Search performance with large datasets | LOW - In-memory DB | LOW | Acceptable for MVP, document for future optimization with real DB |
| Message threading UI complexity | MEDIUM | LOW | Start with simple chronological list, enhance iteratively |
| Review moderation not implemented | LOW - Future feature | HIGH | Document as known limitation, add manual review in future phase |

### Low Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Time zone handling for bookings | LOW | MEDIUM | Use UTC internally, display in sitter's local time (document assumption) |
| Multi-image upload for profiles | LOW | LOW | Start with single image, enhance later |
| Advanced filter performance | LOW | LOW | Simple client-side filtering acceptable for MVP |
