# Specification Quality Checklist: Octopets Pet Sitter Marketplace

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Needed

All clarifications have been resolved. ✅

**Decision Made**: Payment processing will be deferred to a future implementation phase. Initial version will focus on connecting pet owners and sitters, who will arrange payment terms directly.

## Notes

- The specification is high quality with comprehensive user stories, clear functional requirements, and measurable success criteria
- All success criteria are properly technology-agnostic and measurable (e.g., "Pet owners can complete a search and view at least 3 sitter profiles within 2 minutes")
- User stories are well-prioritized with clear P1/P2/P3 designations and independent testing capabilities
- Edge cases are thorough and realistic (double-booking, timezone handling, partial availability, etc.)
- Payment processing has been scoped as a future enhancement, allowing MVP to focus on core marketplace functionality
- **Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`** ✅
