# Feature Specification: Pet Sitter Marketplace Platform

**Feature Branch**: `002-pet-sitter-marketplace2`  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application called Octopets that is like an AirBnB for pet sitters and owners. Pet Owners should be able to search for pet sitters in their location and have scheduling capabilities. Pet sitters should be able to customize their profile, skills, and services offered."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Pet Owner Search & Discovery (Priority: P1)

Pet owners can search for available pet sitters in their geographic area, view profiles, and see services offered. This provides the core value proposition of connecting pet owners with qualified sitters.

**Why this priority**: This is the fundamental marketplace function - without search and discovery, no bookings can occur. It's the entry point for all pet owners and delivers immediate value by showing available options.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a location, viewing search results with sitter profiles, and filtering by basic criteria (availability, services). Delivers value by helping owners discover potential sitters even without booking capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pet owner is on the search page, **When** they enter their zip code or city, **Then** they see a list of pet sitters within their area with profile photos, ratings, and brief service descriptions
2. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** the owner clicks on a sitter profile, **Then** they see detailed information including services offered, experience, rates, availability calendar, and customer reviews
3. **Given** the owner is viewing search results, **When** they apply filters (pet type, service type, date range), **Then** results update to show only matching sitters
4. **Given** no sitters match the search criteria, **When** results are empty, **Then** the system suggests expanding the search radius or adjusting filters

---

### User Story 2 - Booking & Scheduling System (Priority: P2)

Pet owners can request bookings with sitters for specific dates and times, and sitters can accept or decline requests. This enables the transactional aspect of the marketplace.

**Why this priority**: Without booking capability, the platform is just a directory. This transforms it into a functional marketplace where transactions occur. Depends on search/discovery (P1) being in place first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a sitter, choosing available dates from their calendar, submitting a booking request, and verifying the sitter receives the request. Delivers value by enabling actual pet care arrangements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pet owner is viewing a sitter's profile, **When** they select available dates on the calendar and click "Request Booking", **Then** a booking request is created with selected dates, pet details, and service type
2. **Given** a sitter has received a booking request, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** they see pending requests with pet owner details and can accept or decline
3. **Given** a sitter accepts a booking, **When** acceptance is processed, **Then** both parties receive confirmation with booking details, and the sitter's calendar blocks those dates
4. **Given** a booking conflict exists, **When** an owner tries to book already-reserved dates, **Then** the system prevents double-booking and shows alternative available dates
5. **Given** a booking is confirmed, **When** either party needs to cancel, **Then** they can cancel with appropriate notice period (24-48 hours standard) and both parties are notified

### User Story 3 - Pet Sitter Profile Management (Priority: P1)

Pet sitters can create and customize their profiles with services, skills, experience, availability, and rates. This enables sitters to market themselves effectively to potential clients.

**Why this priority**: Sitters need complete profiles before owners can make informed decisions. This is a prerequisite for meaningful search results. Equal priority to search since you need both supply (sitters) and demand (owners) for a marketplace.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by a sitter creating an account, filling out profile sections (bio, services, rates, photos), setting availability, and previewing how their profile appears to owners. Delivers value by allowing sitters to establish their presence on the platform.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new pet sitter creates an account, **When** they access profile setup, **Then** they see form sections for bio, experience, certifications, services offered, pet types accepted, and rate structure
2. **Given** a sitter is editing their profile, **When** they upload photos and videos, **Then** media is stored and displayed on their public profile with a maximum of 10 images
3. **Given** a sitter wants to set their rates, **When** they configure pricing, **Then** they can set different rates per service type (overnight, daily visits, dog walking) and per pet type
4. **Given** a sitter updates their availability calendar, **When** they mark dates as available or blocked, **Then** these dates are reflected in real-time for pet owners viewing their profile
5. **Given** a sitter has special skills or certifications, **When** they add these to their profile (e.g., "Pet First Aid Certified", "Experience with Senior Dogs"), **Then** these appear as searchable tags and badges on their profile

---

### User Story 4 - Review & Rating System (Priority: P3)

Pet owners can leave reviews and ratings after a booking is completed, helping build trust and reputation in the marketplace.

**Why this priority**: While important for trust and quality, the platform can function without reviews initially. Early adopters may book based on profiles alone. This becomes more critical as the platform scales.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing a mock booking, triggering a review prompt, submitting a rating and written review, and verifying it appears on the sitter's profile. Delivers value by helping future owners make better decisions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a booking has been completed, **When** the pet owner logs in within 7 days after service, **Then** they see a prompt to review the sitter with 1-5 star rating and optional written review
2. **Given** an owner submits a review, **When** the review is processed, **Then** it appears on the sitter's profile with the rating contributing to their overall average score
3. **Given** a sitter receives multiple reviews, **When** their profile is viewed, **Then** reviews are sorted by most recent with the overall star rating prominently displayed
4. **Given** a review contains inappropriate content, **When** it's reported or submitted, **Then** the system automatically filters content using content moderation service to detect profanity, hate speech, and policy violations, blocking or flagging reviews that exceed acceptable thresholds

---

### User Story 5 - Communication & Messaging (Priority: P2)

Pet owners and sitters can communicate directly through an in-app messaging system to discuss booking details, pet needs, and special requirements.

**Why this priority**: Essential for coordinating logistics and building trust, but initial bookings can occur via booking requests alone. Becomes more important for complex situations requiring discussion.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending messages between owner and sitter accounts, attaching photos/documents about pet needs, and verifying both parties receive notifications. Delivers value by enabling coordination without sharing personal contact information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pet owner is viewing a sitter's profile, **When** they click "Message", **Then** a conversation thread opens where they can send messages and receive responses
2. **Given** a booking is in progress, **When** either party sends a message, **Then** the other party receives a notification (in-app and email) and can respond
3. **Given** an owner needs to share pet information, **When** they attach photos or documents (vet records, feeding instructions), **Then** files up to 10MB can be attached and viewed by the sitter
4. **Given** a conversation contains multiple messages, **When** viewed, **Then** messages are threaded by booking with timestamps and read receipts

---

### User Story 6 - Pet Owner Account & Pet Profiles (Priority: P1)

Pet owners can create accounts and maintain profiles for each of their pets including medical information, behavioral notes, and care instructions.

**Why this priority**: Pet profiles are foundational data needed for bookings. Sitters need this information to accept or decline requests and provide appropriate care. Must exist before bookings can occur.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an owner account, adding multiple pet profiles with details (name, breed, age, medical needs, temperament), and viewing these profiles from the owner's dashboard. Delivers value by centralizing pet information for all future bookings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new pet owner creates an account, **When** they complete registration, **Then** they're prompted to add their first pet profile with name, type, breed, age, weight, and upload photo
2. **Given** an owner is creating a pet profile, **When** they enter medical information, **Then** they can document allergies, medications, veterinarian contact, vaccination records, and special needs
3. **Given** an owner has multiple pets, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they see all pet profiles and can edit, add new pets, or archive pets no longer in their care
4. **Given** a pet has behavioral notes, **When** an owner documents temperament (friendly with other dogs, shy with strangers, etc.), **Then** this information is shared with sitters during booking requests
5. **Given** an owner updates pet information, **When** they save changes, **Then** updates are immediately reflected in any pending or future bookings
